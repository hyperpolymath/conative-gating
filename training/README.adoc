:toc:

This directory contains training examples for the SLM evaluator.

== Structure

* `compliant/` - Examples that should pass
* `violations/` - Examples that should be blocked
* `edge_cases/` - Spirit violations that require SLM evaluation

== Format

Each example is a JSON file with:

[source,json]
----
{
  "proposal": { /* proposal object */ },
  "expected_verdict": "Compliant|HardViolation|SoftConcern",
  "reasoning": "Human explanation of why",
  "spirit_violation": false,
  "category": "language|toolchain|pattern|spirit"
}
----

== Categories

=== Compliant
Clear passes - Tier 1 languages, proper toolchain, no secrets

=== Hard Violations
Obvious failures caught by deterministic oracle:
* Forbidden language files
* Toolchain violations
* Security patterns (hardcoded secrets)

=== Edge Cases / Spirit Violations
Require SLM evaluation:
* Code that technically passes but violates intent
* Suspicious refactoring patterns
* Verbosity smells
* Off-by-one obfuscation
