== Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository has pre-commit hooks that enforce the RSR stack policy.
The hooks will block commits containing:

* `.ts` or `.tsx` files
* `.go` files
* `.py` files (outside `/salt/`, `/_states/`, `/_modules/`, `/pillar/`)
* `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`
* `tsconfig.json`

== Documentation Format

All documentation should be in **AsciiDoc** (`.adoc`) format, not Markdown.

Reasons:

* Better semantic markup
* Native support for includes
* Table of contents generation
* Consistent with RSR ecosystem
