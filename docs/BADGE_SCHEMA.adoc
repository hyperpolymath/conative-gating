== Dynamic Badge Generation

=== Justfile Recipe
[source,makefile]
----
# Generate badge block from project metadata
badges:
    @./scripts/generate-badges.sh > docs/BADGES.adoc
    @echo "Badges generated in docs/BADGES.adoc"

# Update README with current badges
update-readme-badges:
    @./scripts/update-readme-badges.sh README.adoc
----

=== Generation Script Pattern
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/generate-badges.sh

# Read from STATE.scm or project config
PHASE=$(grep -oP "phase\s*\.\s*\"\K[^\"]*" STATE.scm 2>/dev/null || echo "development")
TIER=$(detect_rsr_tier)
MATURITY=$(grep -oP "maturity\s*\.\s*\"\K[^\"]*" STATE.scm 2>/dev/null || echo "experimental")

# Generate badge URLs
echo "image:https://img.shields.io/badge/RSR-Tier%20${TIER}-${TIER_COLOR}[RSR Tier ${TIER}]"
echo "image:https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-${PHASE}-blue[Phase: ${PHASE}]"
echo "image:https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-${MATURITY}-${MAT_COLOR}[Maturity: ${MATURITY}]"
----

== Cross-Reference Matrix

Projects can be tracked via their relationships in ECOSYSTEM.scm:
